- Please do keep in mind that I'm currently still learning how Python fully works, some things may be a bit iffy however in the future that'll probably change.
- You're also free to take the source code and modify all of the code as a base for your project!

## What can you do with this?
Download YouTube videos and choose a custom directory!

## Current Limitations
- You're unable to download Shorts videos, to fix this issue, go to the video itself, and in the URL, change the "short" keyword in the URL to "watch", and it'll convert it to a normal YouTube video.
- Age Restricted videos will not download

If you have any other issues, please report them [here](https://github.com/zelofi/zelofisYouTubeDownloader/issues)!
