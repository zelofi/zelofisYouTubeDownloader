- Please do keep in mind that I'm currently still learning how Python fully works, some things may be a bit iffy however in the future that'll probably change.
- You're also free to take the source code and modify all of the code as a base for your project!

## What can you do with this?
Download YouTube videos and choose a custom directory!

## How to use it
- Click the green "Code" button and click, "Download ZIP"
- Extract the ZIP file
- Open up "main.py" and you should be good to go!

- If you're experiencing problems however, please do the following.
> - Open up Command Prompt
> - And do the following:
```
pip install customtkinter
pip install pytube
```
- If you're still experiencing errors, make sure you actually have Python installed. [Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Current Limitations
- Some YouTube shorts may or may not work
- Age Restricted videos will not download
- Sometimes, the app itself may break, so just restart it and it should be fine
