- Please do keep in mind that I'm currently still learning how Python fully works, some things may be a bit iffy however in the future that'll probably change.
- You're also free to take the source code and modify all of the code as a base for your project!

## What can you do with this?
Download YouTube videos and choose a custom directory!

## Current Limitations
- Some YouTube shorts may or may not work
- Age Restricted videos will not download

If you have any other issues, please report them [here](https://github.com/zelofi/zelofisYouTubeDownloader/issues)!
